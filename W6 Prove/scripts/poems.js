    title:"'Twas Just Two Hearts ",
    poemText:`
    A world of fear bore down upon them
Alone and isolated hope was waning
Thrown together one took a chance
Still the light of hope refused to show its path
Courage sparked and hope was found

Slow and timid were the journey's steps
Fear holding back the light of hope
Through the night of fear courage held
Till fear gave way and hope shown through
Strength blossomed and courage grew

'Twas just two hearts and love found its roots
Beat by beat the chains of pain fall away
Beat by beat hope shines brighter
Beat by beat love grows deeper
Beat by beat two hearts draw closer

Beat by beat a new scene unfolds
Hope laced through every shadow
Joy scattered through every valley
Courage found on every mountainside
The sky above blanketed in love

While fear tries to rule again
Desire creeps through the two hearts
To take this new journey
As one takes a chance and asks
Deanne Jensen will you marry me?`,

Will you let me cast my dreams aside to lift your heart, as your love fills mine?
Will you continue to lift me to taste of eternity, by the touch of thy hand?
Will you let me lift you through the eternities, to touch the glory above?
Will you let me dance within thy gaze, and bathe within your hopes?
Will you let me spend my strength, to fulfill your dreams?
Will you let me spend my life, to give thee love?
Will you let me give my heart to thee?
Will you marry me?`,

    poemText:`A thousand days before
I had just started to see your love
A thousand days from now
I shall long to love you
A thousand more

To live a thousand lives
In a thousand days
I still could ne'er hope to find
Even a glimpse 
Of the love we share

I've asked you twice before
And I hope to ask you
A thousand more
Just to see
The love of a thousand years
Light up as you hear
My Love
My Angel Queen
Will you marry me?`,

We are two
But I hope to be one
I hope our hearts will join
And be as one

Will you come with me
Take my hand
And dance 
That beautiful dance
That lets us be as one

Will you marry me
And help me forge our family
So that we two
May become three
Through our new one`,

And I've seen your bad
I've seen your ups
And I've seen your downs
I've seen your strengths 
And I've seen your weaknesses 
I've seen every part of your heart 
And every portion of your soul 
I know you well 
Well enough to say
I love every part of you 
And I want to be a part of all of it
Will you let me show you 
All the joys I have seen 
Within your soul
Will you let me show you 
All the strength I have found 
Through your heart
Will you let me share your journey 
Through time and all eternity

It's more than time
more
Than everything which has come before
And more …
than all I could ever hope to be
Yet still
Here is it
… here you are
… we are
And what we have
Is more than bliss
more than joy
more than hope
and even more
than love
…
It's an eternity
I want to spend with you
An eternity
That drives me to ask

It never has
And it never will
You deserve more
So much more
Even more than a queen
For you are an Angel Queen
And deserve to feel as such
And as an Angel Queen
So I offer you my love
My loyalty
My support
And my strength
For as long as eternity goes on
I offer you my heart
And everything that goes with it
In return I simply ask
Beg and plead

Today
I read you a poem
Asking for your hand in marriage
Asking you to join me
In a journey that will last eternity

Today
I look back on our love
And realize the strength behind it
I realize the beauty of celebrating the start of our union
On the same day we celebrate your birth

Eight years ago
I took a chance
A chance
That let me find eternity
Feel heaven
And taste of its glories

So today
I celebrate eight years
And ask again
Deanne, 
My Beautiful Angel Queen
will you marry me?`,

    poemText:`It is not the beginning
nor is it the end
and the bumps along the way
are not random events
... 
they are tools given by a loving God 
given to help us learn and grow
as we slowly work our way 
back to Him
...
back to Him 
that is my goal 
that is my hope 
my dream 
...
to get back to Him 
we will have to work 
we will have to pray
and we will have to grow 
...
and if we am to grow
we will need strength
we will need each other’s help
we will need to feel love
...
we will need to feel
the love of an angel
flowing freely
filling every part of our life
...
And if I am to become more
then I need heaven's choicest blessings
I need someone so special
she could only be called a Beautiful Angel Queen
...
So I ask you now
Deanne
my Beautiful Angel Queen
will you marry me?`,

You've changed my life
You've changed my outlook
You've changed my goals
And even my dreams
There is not one part of me
Your love has not touched
Thanks to you
I finally know who I am
Who I'm meant to be
And who I can be
And I know
Without you
I'll never get there
For you
My Beautiful Angel Queen
Are my hope
My strength
My dream
My love
And my taste of heaven
So I ask you today
